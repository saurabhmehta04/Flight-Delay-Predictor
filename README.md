# Flight-Delay-Predictor

MainActivity      - Implements the landing screen of the android app, uses 
                    TestAlgorithm.java to predict the result of the user input

DisplayResult     - Implements an activity to display results of the prediction

TrainAlgorithm    - Implements Support Vector Machine algorithm using WEKA libraries to 
                    perform training on the data and output a model file
                    
TestAlgorithm     - uses the model generated by TrainAlgorithm.java and predicts using 
                    test instance whether flight will be delayed or not
